            Over the years, we have contracted with carefully selected car
            chippers. First in Denmark and Sweden - later we have expanded to
            Germany and France among others, and today we collect parts from
            more than 100 suppliers in several European countries, from which
            approved and tested spare parts are sent daily to customers all over
            the world. The number of spare parts in the shop is growing and
            today we are one of Europe's largest online marketplaces for the
            sale of used original spare parts.
